# Search Algorithm Visualiser
## _by shardhrv_


Two Processing files that each have an implementation of 
A* and Dijkstra Pathfinding algorithms in order to find the 
best possible.

## TODO
- Standardise Node Class
- Refactor code to be in-line with OOP principles
- Expand to other search algorithms

## Features
- Creates a randomly generated map to traverse for A* and Dijkstra
- Can track the progress of the algorithm visually 

A great helper tool in order to better understand the inner workings of pathfinding algos.
